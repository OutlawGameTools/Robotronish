# Robotronish

Inspired by watching Robotron, I created this with Corona SDK mainly just to play around with some simple game mechanics.

But now it's into github so I can go off on a tangent but come back here if I hit a dead end.

To play, tap the screen to start each level, then swipe to move the white dot in the center (you) to rescue the green dots. While you are traveling you can tap the screen to shoot in that direction.

Some enemies don't move, but if you get close enough they start shooting at you (fortunately, I haven't coded their bullet collisions yet so you won't die). Some enemies chase you, and other stand there until you get closer to them, and then they chase you.
